ICSE 2020 Student Volunteer Handbook
===

Thank you for being a Student Volunteer (SV) at ICSE 2020. As you already know,
ICSE 2020 is going virtual for the first time ever. This means, you are going to
be the first virtual SV in the history of ICSE!

The main role of SVs is to run the conference smoothly. You will help
participants get the most out of the conference, and make them happy all through
the conference.

This handbook should provide you with the main information about your duties at
ICSE 2020. If you have any questions or suggestions, please feel free to create
a PR (Pull Request). We will do our best to update this document up to date.

## Understanding Virtual ICSE

The whole conference runs by three (plus one for China) independent teams in
three different time bands. The three time bands are the Pacific, Indian
(Asian), and Atlantic time band, which will cover `00:00 - 03:00`, `07:00 -
10:00`, and `15:00 - 18:00` in UTC. For more detailed information, please visit
the main [ICSE web site](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2020).

Each team will take care of three-hour-long sessions per day. Specifically, each
team will handle regular sessions for two hours, and smaller event sessions,
such as poster and demo sessions, for one hour.

## ICSE Live! Team

The conference will be live-cast to youtube (and to iQIYI for Chineses friends),
and there are four dedicated teams that we call ["ICSE Live!
Team"](https://2020.icse-conferences.org/committee/icse-2020-virtualization-regional-live--team-leaders)
for each time band (plus China). Please note that live broadcasting should be
done by the ICSE Live! Team, but not by SVs. The role of SVs should not be
confused with the ones of Live! Team.

To understand how the ICSE Live! Teams operate, see
[this](https://github.com/crista/icse2020-live).

## SV Types

Unlike traditional conferences, we divide SVs into two groups: online SVs, and
offline SVs.

- *Online SVs* work closely with a regional [ICSE Live!
  team](#icse-live-team). We will assign Online SVs based on which time band
  they belong to. For example, SVs in the Pacific time band will work with the
  Pacific team.

- *Offline SVs* work asynchronously to help edit videos, and upload videos to
  either youtube or iQIYI. Therefore, offline SVs do not need to be bound to a
  specific time zone.

## SV Chairs

SV chairs lead the overall organization of SVs and interface with the general
chair and live teams. Contact SV chairs in your time band.

- Pacific Time Band: [FIXME](FIXME)
- Indian (Asian) Time Band: [Sang Kil Cha](https://softsec.kaist.ac.kr/~sangkilc/)
- Atlantic Time Band: [Hamid Bagheri](https://cse.unl.edu/~hbagheri/)

## Slack for All Communication

It is absolutely critical that we communicate effectively and continuously
during the conference. We will be using Slack fo all communication between
SVs.

### Slack Channels

Please join the following channels ASAP.

- `#sv-general` is the main form of communication.
- `#sv-pacific` is ... (TODO: let's see if these are necessary)
- `#sv-indian` is ...
- `#sv-atlantic` is ...

### Slack Display Name

To indicate you are an SV, you will have to change your display name to have a
prefix `[SV]`. For example, if your name is John Doe, then your display name
should become `[SV] John Doe`.

## Description of SV Tasks

Both online and offline SVs have their own expected tasks.

### Online SV

#### Live Casting Helper

We will assign two live casting helpers per session. If there are three parallel
sessions at the same time, we will assign a total of six SVs for this task.

Live casting helpers are in charge of the followings:
- Make sure all the speakers are connected before a session start.
- Keep track of the time and let the session chair know (via Slack) if a talk
  goes too long.
- Arrange questions from Slack and Slido and give them to the session chair.

#### Help Desk Manager

We will assign one or two SV(s) for managing a virtual help desk. The help desk
runs for 8 hours for each time band.

- Pacific time band: 00:00 - 8:00 UTC
- Indian time band: 08:00 - 16:00 UTC
- Atlantic time band: 16:00 - 24:00 UTC

The main role of help desk manager is to handle FAQs during the live
broadcasting.

(TODO: fill me)

#### Social Media Helper

We will assign zero or one SV (depending on the resource). The main role of
social media helper is to advertise talks on social media. You can use your
personal account, or create a new one just for ICSE.

The main conference hashtag is `#icse2020`.
